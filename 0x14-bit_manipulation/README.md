This is a repo on bitwise operations
a << b = a * 2^b
a >> b = a / 2^b (taking decimal not float)
~ a = -(a + 1)

a | b = operand || on binary form of a and b
a & b = operand && on binary form of a and b
a ^ b = operates on binary form. if both are the same then result 0 else result 1.

When all together. it follows the precedence below
Arithmetric Operators : /, *, +, -
Bitwise operands : &

Ox shows its hexadecimal
To convert, last number by 1 (last)
last but one by 16 (second to last)
last but two by 16x16 (third to last)
last but three by 16x16x16 (fourth to last)
last but four by 16x16x16x16 (fifth to last)
